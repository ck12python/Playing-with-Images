## Resize
Image resizing refers to the scaling of images. Scaling comes in handy in many image processing as well as machine learning applications. It helps in reducing the number of pixels from an image and that has several advantages e.g. It can reduce the time of training of a neural network as more is the number of pixels in an image more is the number of input nodes that in turn increases the complexity of the model.
It also helps in zooming in images. Many times we need to resize the image i.e. either shrink it or scale up to meet the size requirements. OpenCV provides us several interpolation methods for resizing an image.
 

Choice of Interpolation Method for Resizing â€“ 

- cv2.INTER_AREA: This is used when we need to shrink an image.
- cv2.INTER_CUBIC: This is slow but more efficient.
- cv2.INTER_LINEAR: This is primarily used when zooming is required. This is the default interpolation technique in OpenCV.

## Blur

Image Blurring refers to making the image less clear or distinct. It is done with the help of various low pass filter kernels.

Advantages of blurring:

- It helps in Noise removal. As noise is considered as high pass signal so by the application of low pass filter kernel we restrict noise.
- It helps in smoothing the image.
- Low intensity edges are removed.
- It helps in hiding the details when necessary. For e.g. in many cases police deliberately want to hide the face of the victim, in such cases blurring is required.

#### Important types of blurring:

Gaussian Blurring:Gaussian blur is the result of blurring an image by a Gaussian function. It is a widely used effect in graphics software, typically to reduce image noise and reduce detail. It is also used as a preprocessing stage before applying our machine learning or deep learning models.

Median Blur: The Median Filter is a non-linear digital filtering technique, often used to remove noise from an image or signal. Median filtering is very widely used in digital image processing because, under certain conditions, it preserves edges while removing noise. It is one of the best algorithms to remove Salt and pepper noise.

Bilateral Blur: A bilateral filter is a non-linear, edge-preserving, and noise-reducing smoothing filter for images. It replaces the intensity of each pixel with a weighted average of intensity values from nearby pixels. This weight can be based on a Gaussian distribution. Thus, sharp edges are preserved while discarding the weak ones.

## Grayscaling

Grayscaling is the process of converting an image from other color spaces e.g. RGB, CMYK, HSV, etc. to shades of gray. It varies between complete black and complete white.

Importance of grayscaling 
- Dimension reduction: For example, In RGB images there are three color channels and has three dimensions while grayscale images are single-dimensional.
- Reduces model complexity: Consider training neural article on RGB images of 10x10x3 pixel. The input layer will have 300 input nodes. On the other hand, the same neural network will need only 100 input nodes for grayscale images.
- For other algorithms to work: Many algorithms are customized to work only on grayscale images e.g. Canny edge detection function pre-implemented in OpenCV library works on Grayscale images only.
